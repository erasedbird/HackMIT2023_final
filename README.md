# Reflexion Buddy

In the United States, 21% of adults experience at least one mental illness. The most prominent showcase of this was during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have seen mental health cases persist ever since. When it comes to mental wellbeing, there is one strategy that trumps all the others - journaling.

Jouranling promotes a vast array of health benefits, many of which have been shown to help the most successful people achieve their dreams. These benefits include clarity of thought, emotional resilience, boosting creativity, increasing presence, and allowing for documentation.

We propose an AI-powered journaling assistant with the following features to improve both the accessibility and personal impact of journaling:

* Speech-to-text: For those who have difficulty typing/writing
* Response interaction: To provide insightful questions and feedback on the journal
* Image generation: To make the journaling experience more enjoyable and visual, and thereby increasing the probability that someone will journal
* Text-to-speech: Reads responses out loud for users

With these innovations, we are certain that users' mental health and wellbeing will be positively affected, and the journaling process will become more accessible.
